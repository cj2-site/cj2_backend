## purpose:
This API exists to hopefully make live a little simpler for anyone that works with color.
Send a color to one of our many endpoints and receive a color palette back, complete with the color name and hex codes.

## summary
The Color Wheel API provides color palettes based on user input and the color wheel.
Each endpoint takes a color name and returns a JSON object for their specific color scheme:
	- GetAnalogousPalette: Returns an [analogous palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogous_colors).
	- GetComplementaryPalette: Returns a [complementary palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors).
	- GetSplitComplementaryPalette: Returns [split complementary palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Complementary).
	- GetTetradicPalette: Returns [tetradic palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Tetradic).
	- GetTriadicPalette: Returns [triadic palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Triadic).

The Color Wheel API can also take a palette of color names and tell you if it matches a specific color scheme:
	- CheckAnalogous: Returns true if the three colors match an Analogous palette and false if it doesn't.
	- CheckComplementary: Returns true if the three colors match a Complementary palette and false if it doesn't.
	- CheckSplitComplementary: Returns true if the three colors match an Split Complementary palette and false if it doesn't.
	- CheckTetradic: Returns true if the four colors match an Tetradic palette and false if it doesn't.
	- CheckTriadic: Returns true if the three colors match a Triadic palette and false if it doesn't.

## methods
Each controller has a two Get methods. One method handles the Get\[scheme\]Palette route and takes a single color, verifies the inbound color exists in the database, creates a palette if the color is in the specified palette table, and returns an error if either the palette or color is null. If not, it creates a Color object for each color in the palette, puts it in a list, and then returns the list of Color objects via the ASP.NET Core OK method.
The other Get method handles the Check\[scheme\] route. It takes in 3-4 colors, verifies they are in the database, and returns an error if they are not. If they are in the database, the colors are thrown into a palette and then compared against the scheme specified in the route. If it exists, the colors match the scheme and a true response is sent back. If it doesn't, the colors don't match within the scheme and a false response is sent.

## notes
- Colors sent to an endpoint must be sent via a capitalize string, i.e. Red
- Colors that are made up of two color names must have a both names capitalized and a dash between them, i.e. Yellow-Green
